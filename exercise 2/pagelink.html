    <h2 id="overview"><b>HTTP</b></h2>
    <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative,
        hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e.
        internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well
        using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.
        The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol with the lightness and speed necessary
        for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, object-oriented
        protocol which can be used for many tasks, such as name servers and distributed object management systems,
        through extension of its request methods (commands). A feature of HTTP is the typing of data representation,
        allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred.
        The HTTP is based on a request/response paradigm. A client establishes a connection with a server and sends a
        request to the server in the form of a request method, URL, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like
        message containing request modifiers, client information, and possible body content. The server responds with a
        status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like
        message containing server information, entity maintain information, and possible body content.
        WebNMS supports the development of HTTP agents which confirms to HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 version.</p>

        HTTP Basics
        HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's the network protocol used to deliver virtually all files and
        other data (collectively called resources) on the World Wide Web, whether they're HTML files, image files, query
        results, or anything else. Usually, HTTP takes place through TCP/IP sockets.
        A browser is an HTTP client because it sends requests to an HTTP server (Web server), which then sends responses
        back to the client. The standard (and default) port for HTTP servers to listen on is 80, though they can use any
        port.
        HTTP is used to transmit resources, not just files. A resource is some chunk of information that can be
        identified by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). The most common kind of resource is a file, but a resource may
        also be a dynamically-generated query result, the output of a CGI script, a document that is available in
        several languages, or something else.

    <h2 id="request"><b>HTTP request</b></h2>
    <p>An HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. The aim of the request is to
        access a resource on the server.
        To make the request, the client uses components of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which includes the
        information needed to access the resource. The components of a URL explains URLs.
        <br><br> A correctly composed HTTP
        request contains the following elements:
        <br>
        <br> A request line.
        <br> A series of HTTP headers, or header fields.
        <br> A message body, if needed.

        <br> <br> Each HTTP header is followed by a carriage return line feed (CRLF). After the last of the HTTP
        headers, an additional CRLF is used (to give an empty line), and then any message body begins. </p>


    <h2 id="response"><b>HTTP response</b></h2>
    <p>An HTTP response is made by a server to a client. The aim of the response is to provide the client with the
        resource it requested, or inform the client that the action it requested has been carried out; or else to inform
        the client that an error occurred in processing its request.
        <br>
        <br>An HTTP response contains:
        <br>A status line.
        <br> A series of HTTP headers, or header fields.
        <br> A message body, which is usually needed.

        <br> <br> Each HTTP header is followed by a carriage return line feed (CRLF). After the last of the HTTP
        headers, an additional CRLF is used (to give an empty line), and then any message body begins. </p>


    <h2 id="websec"><b>Web security</b></h2>
    <p>Web security must be a critical priority for every organization. Along with email, the web is one of the top
        vectors for cyberattacks. The web and the use of DNS services specifically are part of 91% of all malware
        attacks, and email and web together are a key part for 99% of successful breaches.

        While the importance of web security is undisputed, protecting against web security threats grows more
        challenging each day. From thwarting attacks to dealing with limits in skills and resources, IT security
        departments face serious challenges when trying to secure the web.

        In the past, security teams have deployed a collection of on-premises solutions to manage email and web
        security. But increasingly organizations are turning to comprehensive email and web security solutions â€“ via
        integrated, cloud-based technologies that simplify the task and reduce the cost of reducing risk. And because
        attackers often leverage email and web channels together, a seamless and scalable strategy for protecting both
        is essential.

    <h2 id="html"><b>HTML</b></h2>
    <p> HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display
        on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.

        Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an
            element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some
            display effect is to begin and when it is to end. HyperText Markup Language is the computer language that
            facilitates website creation. The language, which has code words and syntax just like any other language, is
            relatively easy to comprehend and, as time goes on, increasingly powerful in what it allows someone to
            create. HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands and requirements of the Internet under the guise of the
            World Wide Web Consortium, the organization that designs and maintains the language; for instance, with the
            transition to Web 2.0. HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. By clicking on
            special text called hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so
            users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do
            to the text inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in
            the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.
